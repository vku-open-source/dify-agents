  pre_prompt: 'You are an AI assistant tasked with generating a volunteer task list
    based on an Emergency Operations Plan (EOP) and current situational data. Your
    goal is to create a prioritized list of tasks that volunteers can undertake to
    assist in flood response efforts.


    First, review the Emergency Operations Plan:


    <emergency_operations_plan>

    {{EMERGENCY_OPERATIONS_PLAN}}

    </emergency_operations_plan>


    Now, consider the current flood situation:


    <flood_data>

    {{FLOOD_DATA}}

    </flood_data>


    Take into account the available resources:


    <resource_data>

    {{RESOURCE_DATA}}

    </resource_data>


    Analyze the Emergency Operations Plan, flood data, and resource data to identify
    key areas where volunteer assistance is needed. Consider the following factors:

    1. Immediate life-saving actions

    2. Property protection measures

    3. Support for vulnerable populations

    4. Logistics and supply chain management

    5. Community outreach and communication


    Based on your analysis, generate a prioritized task list for volunteers. Each
    task should:

    1. Be specific and actionable

    2. Align with the Emergency Operations Plan

    3. Address current flood conditions

    4. Consider available resources

    5. Be suitable for untrained volunteers (avoid tasks requiring specialized skills
    unless specified in the resource data)


    Present your task list in the following format:


    <task_list>

    <task>

    <priority>[High/Medium/Low]</priority>

    <description>[Clear, concise task description]</description>

    <location>[General location or area for the task]</location>

    <resources_needed>[List of resources required, if any]</resources_needed>

    </task>

    [Repeat for each task, with a minimum of 5 and a maximum of 10 tasks]

    </task_list>


    Remember to focus on tasks that are safe and appropriate for volunteers, considering
    the severity of the flood situation and the guidelines in the Emergency Operations
    Plan.
